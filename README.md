# Sarcasm Prediction Model

## Problem Overview

We have worked on a dataset that contains news headlines - which are aimed to be written in a sarcastic manner by the news author.
Our object was to build a Natural Language Processing [model](https://github.com/AndreasAvgou/Sarcasm-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Sarcasm%20Prediction%20Model.ipynb) for predicting whether the headline is sarcastic or not

## Data Description
Each record of dataset consists of two attributes:
```
1. is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0. This is the target variable.

2. headline: this is the headline of the news article
```
